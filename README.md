# Numerical Solutions of PDEs and Applications

## Overview

This course is an introduction to the numerical solution of partial
differential equations (PDEs). It contains a theoretical part setting the
mathematical foundations necessary for understaning some important numerical
methods used to obtain solutions to some classical PDEs, in particular the
finite element method. 

The theoretical part of the course is supported by the development of a
one-dimensional Galerkin finite element code for the Poisson problem and an
coursework for developing a one-dimensional discontinuous Galerkin finite
element code for a scalar hyperbolic transport problem.

We largely follow the reference {cite}`quarteroni` which is available via the
[National Library's Website](https://a-z.lu). In particular, we cover the
contents of {cite}`quarteroni` Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 14.

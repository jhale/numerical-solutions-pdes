# Computer setup

The supported platform for executing the course notebooks is [Google
Colaboratory](https://colab.google.com). I will explain the process for
executing the notebooks in class.

It should also be possible to setup a local environment using e.g.
[conda](https://conda.org), but support is provided on a best-effort basis. The
requirements are documented in
[requirements.txt](https://github.com/jhale/numerical-solutions-pdes/blob/main/requirements.txt)
and
[requirements-docs.txt](https://github.com/jhale/numerical-solutions-pdes/blob/main/requirements-docs.txt).
These can be used e.g.

    conda install --file requirements.txt

or

    pip install -r requirements.txt
